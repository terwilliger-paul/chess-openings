This is Phalanx XXIV built on a 32-bit Cygwin system + GCC 4.8.3

GCC -fprofile-generate with a benchmark run followed by -fprofile-use was used along with:

-O3
-mtune=core2
-fprofile-use
-fno-unroll-loops (smaller and a bit faster than the default)

Benchmark test:

Intel SU4100, Windows 7 (32bit) - 396000 nps
